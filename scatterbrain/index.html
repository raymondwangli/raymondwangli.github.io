        <p>
          Most of the writing here will involve my patterns of thinking, which are usually driven by abstract reflection rather than concrete experimentation. Frankly, these ideas have yet to undergo enough real world testing. Trying to measure their success involves a number of challenges, as worldly results are 
          <ul>
            <li>subject to chance</li>
            <li>open to interpretation</li>
            <li>difficult to attribute to any one fundamental idea</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This website will externalize my ideas in a semi-public form. In the long term, I hope this will help reconcile a number of difficult questions, such as
          <ul>
            <li>whether a way of thinking yields results because of its inherent validity or because of luck</li>
            <li>how long one should commit to a given strategy (because how is one to know, in the middle of executing a strategy that seems to be failing, whether maintaining it for longer would bring success? or vice versa?)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This website welcomes critique. Ideas are loosely held, and nothing is taken personally. It's all in the name of better thinking and growth (to hopefully increase worldly results).
