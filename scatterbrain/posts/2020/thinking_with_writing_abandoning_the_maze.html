      <h1>Thinking with Writing: Abandoning the Maze</h1>

          I believe writing is a thinking tool. I tried to make this point with a <a href="https://raymondwangli.github.io/scatterbrain/posts/2019/thinking_with_writing_the_maze_analogy.html" target="_blank">maze-solving analogy</a> that contrasts two strategies:
          <ul>
            <li>walking through a maze</li>
            <li>drawing paths on a map of the maze</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          My roommate had a valid critique: one strategy has a map and the other doesn’t. This is an unfair information advantage, so my analogy is flawed. I abandon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s the root of what I was getting at. I believe all methods of externalization, such as
          <ul>
            <li>making physical models</li>
            <li>writing</li>
            <li>drawing</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          are thinking mediums. I feel like a quote from Michelangelo (the sculptor) best summarizes my view: “Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The act of writing is the discovery, exploration, and recording of thought. The final draft is hopefully precise and accurate to the idea you had in your head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you’ve written such that other people interpret your work in the way you intended is another discussion.
